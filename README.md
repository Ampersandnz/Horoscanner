# Horoscanner
Barcode-scanning horoscope generation app for Android

Mostly just a fun little side project. 
End goal is to hash the barcode with the current date (and possibly some user information), and output:
- A set of lucky numbers
- An animal of the day (with picture)
- Some inspiration quote-type thing
- A colour
- Anything else I can think of that seems interesting

Wishlist:
- Generate text via some kind of neural network/learning algorithm/markov process
- Provide facial recognition as well as barcode scanning (makes a lot more sense, although anyone who believes in horoscopes will probably be okay with scanning a random object to tell their specific future anyway)
