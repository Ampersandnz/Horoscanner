# Horoscanner
Barcode-scanning horoscope generation app for Android

Mostly just a fun little side project. 
End goal is to hash the barcode with the current date (and possibly some user information), and output:
- A set of lucky numbers
- An animal of the day (with picture)
- Some inspiration quote-type thing
-- Ideally generated via neural network/learning algorithm/Markov process, although this may end up being unreadable
- A colour
- Anything else I can think of that seems interesting
